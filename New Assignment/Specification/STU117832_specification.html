    <h1>Task one</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p><span>Scalability:</span> Enable the organization to scale its infrastructure up or down as needed, ensuring that
        resources are available to meet increasing or decreasing demand.</p>
    <p><span>Cost Efficiency:</span>Reduce infrastructure costs by optimizing resource utilization, implementing
        cost-effective hardware and software solutions, and automating resource provisioning and management.</p>
    <p><span>Resource Consolidation: </span> Consolidate physical hardware resources into a virtualized environment to
        improve resource utilization and reduce the data center footprint.</p>
    <p>Flexibility: Provide flexibility in terms of operating systems, programming languages, and application stacks to
        support a variety of workloads and use cases.</p>
    <p>Resource Isolation: Ensure resource isolation and security by using virtualization or containerization
        technologies, allowing multiple users or departments to share the infrastructure while maintaining separation.
    </p>
    <p>High Availability: Ensure high availability of applications and services by implementing redundancy, failover
        mechanisms, and disaster recovery plans.</p>
    <p>Security: Implement robust security measures to protect data, applications, and infrastructure. This includes
        access controls, encryption, monitoring, and compliance with relevant regulations.</p>
    <p>Automation: Implement automation for resource provisioning, configuration management, and scaling to reduce
        manual intervention and improve efficiency.</p>
